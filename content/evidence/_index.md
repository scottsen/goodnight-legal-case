# Evidence

## Smoking Gun Evidence

### Professional Documentation of Violations
**Source:** Danielle Smith, LMHCA (#MC61294206)  
**Date:** May 1, 2025  
**Document:** Larch Counseling Therapy Notes, Page 99

> "Client called stepmom, 'mom' throughout our session"

**Legal Significance:** Licensed professional documented direct court order violation without correction. Grounds for emergency contempt and professional sanctions.

### Judicial Authority Violation
**Source:** Judge Rampersad Court Findings  
**Date:** March 3, 2022

> "Ms. Goodnight is highly sensitive to children's emotional needs"  
> "Mr. Ralidak is NOT [sensitive to children's emotional needs]"

**Legal Significance:** Judge's credibility determinations systematically violated for 7+ months. Direct challenge to judicial authority requiring immediate enforcement.

### Criminal Conspiracy Evidence
**Issue:** Sexual abuse allegations against "Grandpa"  
**Mother's Response:** "Raina has NEVER been near 'Grandpa' (called 'Pops') - full bs."

**Legal Significance:** Physical impossibility proves fabricated evidence creation. Criminal referral warranted under 18 USC Â§ 1001 (false statements by professional).
