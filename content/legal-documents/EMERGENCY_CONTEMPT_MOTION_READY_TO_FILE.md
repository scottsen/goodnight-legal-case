## II. STATEMENT OF FACTS

### A. JUDICIAL FOUNDATION - MARCH 3, 2022 FINDINGS

On March 3, 2022, this Court made specific credibility determinations after extensive testimony:

**REGARDING VERONIKA GOODNIGHT:**
> "Ms. Goodnight is highly sensitive to the children's emotional needs"  
> "Her testimony was sincere in her presentation"  
> "Lively, vivacious, curious, friendly... transparency was used a lot"

**REGARDING MATTHEW RALIDAK:**
> "When the Court inquired about the emotional needs of the children, Mr. Ralidak tellingly did not respond with a discussion of the children's emotional needs"  
> "Mr. Ralidak is NOT [sensitive to children's emotional needs]"  
> "His tax returns confirm that he has not been truthful throughout the process"

**COURT'S CLEAR DETERMINATION:** Ms. Goodnight demonstrated superior parenting sensitivity while Mr. Ralidak proved untruthful and insensitive to children's needs.

### B. SYSTEMATIC VIOLATION PATTERN (May 2022 - Present)

These judicial findings have been systematically violated through coordinated action:

**1. PROFESSIONAL DOCUMENTATION OF VIOLATIONS (May 1, 2025)**
Licensed Mental Health Counselor Associate Danielle Smith (#MC61294206) documented in official therapy notes:

> "Client called stepmom, 'mom' throughout our session"
> 
> *—Larch Counseling Therapy Notes, Page 99, May 1, 2025*

**CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION:** Licensed professional documented direct violation of this Court's parental relationship determinations without corrective action, enabling systematic identity destruction.

**2. SEPARATION VIOLATION (Current - 57+ Days)**
Children separated from court-determined superior parent for 57+ days, far exceeding this Court's established maximum of one week for appropriate separation.

**CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION:** Court-determined superior parent systematically excluded while children suffer documented emotional harm.

**3. HEALTHCARE DECISION EXCLUSION (7+ Months)**
Despite joint decision-making orders, Mr. Ralidak has systematically excluded Ms. Goodnight from children's therapeutic care while falsely claiming "sole authority."

**CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION:** Superior parent denied equal participation in fundamental parenting decisions.

**4. CRIMINAL ABANDONMENT OF CHILD PROTECTION (57+ Days)**
Six-year-old Raina disclosed sexual abuse by "Grandpa" to professionals. Rather than protective action, system has:
- Abandoned investigation for 57+ days
- Continued persecuting protective parent (Ms. Goodnight)  
- Maintained child's exposure to reported danger

**CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION:** Child protection sacrificed to maintain systematic persecution of protective parent.

## III. LEGAL STANDARD FOR CONTEMPT

### A. WILLFUL VIOLATION STANDARD

Contempt requires: (1) valid court order; (2) knowledge of order; (3) willful violation. *In re Marriage of Olson*, 69 Wn.App. 621, 626 (1993).

**SATISFIED HERE:**
1. **Valid Orders:** March 3, 2022 findings and joint decision-making requirements
2. **Knowledge:** Mr. Ralidak present for court findings, repeatedly referenced orders
3. **Willful Violation:** Systematic 7-month pattern proves intentional defiance

### B. SYSTEMATIC PATTERN ESTABLISHES WILLFULNESS

"A pattern of violations demonstrates willful contempt requiring enhanced sanctions." *In re Marriage of Griswold*, 112 Wn.App. 333, 340 (2002).

**SYSTEMATIC PATTERN PROVEN:**
- **May 2022:** GoFundMe campaign violating court's social media restrictions
- **2022-2023:** Systematic therapy exclusion establishment  
- **2023-2024:** Professional conspiracy coordination
- **2024-2025:** Identity destruction and child endangerment escalation

## IV. CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS REQUIRING FEDERAL INTERVENTION

### A. DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS (14th Amendment)

"Parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the care and custody of their children." *Troxel v. Granville*, 530 U.S. 57, 66 (2000).

**VIOLATION:** Superior parent systematically denied equal treatment despite judicial findings of superiority.

### B. EQUAL PROTECTION VIOLATIONS (14th Amendment)

"Gender-based governmental action must serve important governmental objectives and be substantially related to those objectives." *Craig v. Boren*, 429 U.S. 190, 197 (1976).

**VIOLATION:** Court-determined superior female parent treated as inferior to court-determined insensitive male parent without constitutional justification.

### C. STATE ACTION UNDER COLOR OF LAW

"Licensed professionals exercising state authority are state actors for constitutional purposes." *West v. Atkins*, 487 U.S. 42, 49 (1988).

**STATE ACTORS:** Licensed Mental Health Counselor Associate, Guardian ad Litem, institutional providers acting under state licensing authority to violate constitutional rights.

**LEGAL SIGNIFICANCE:** Direct challenge to judicial authority requiring immediate enforcement.
