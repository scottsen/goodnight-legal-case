2. Plaintiff seeks damages, injunctive relief, and attorney fees for systematic violation of federally protected constitutional rights through coordinated state action under color of law.

3. Licensed professionals, acting under color of state authority, have systematically violated Plaintiff's fundamental parental rights and constitutional protections through seven months of coordinated persecution.

---

4. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. § 1343 (civil rights jurisdiction).

5. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because substantial acts occurred in this judicial district.

6. This action seeks relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of rights secured by the Constitution and federal law.

---

## III. PARTIES

### PLAINTIFF

7. **VERONIKA GOODNIGHT** is a United States citizen residing in King County, Washington.

8. Ms. Goodnight is the mother of three minor children and was judicially determined to be "highly sensitive to children's emotional needs" and the superior parent by Washington State Court.

### DEFENDANTS

9. **MATTHEW RALIDAK** is a United States citizen residing in King County, Washington, and father of the minor children.

10. **DANIELLE SMITH, LMHCA** (#MC61294206) is a Licensed Mental Health Counselor Associate acting under color of state law through professional licensing authority.

11. **LARCH COUNSELING PLLC** is a Washington State corporation providing therapeutic services under state licensing authority and supervision.

12. **DOES 1-10** are additional state actors whose identities will be ascertained through discovery.

---

## IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

### A. CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATION

13. On March 3, 2022, King County Superior Court Judge Rampersad made specific findings after extensive testimony determining Ms. Goodnight as the superior parent:

> "Ms. Goodnight is highly sensitive to children's emotional needs"  
> "Mr. Ralidak is NOT [sensitive to children's emotional needs]"  
> "His tax returns confirm that he has not been truthful throughout the process"

14. These judicial findings established Ms. Goodnight's constitutional status as the protective, truthful, and emotionally sensitive parent entitled to equal treatment and fundamental parental rights.

### B. SYSTEMATIC CONSPIRACY INITIATION (2022-2023)

15. Beginning in May 2022, Defendants initiated coordinated action to systematically violate Judge Rampersad's constitutional findings through:

a) Public fundraising campaign raising $5,557 through false allegations violating court orders;
b) Systematic exclusion of judicially-determined superior parent from children's healthcare decisions;
c) Professional institutional capture to enable ongoing constitutional violations.

16. These actions were coordinated between Defendants to deny Ms. Goodnight equal treatment despite judicial superiority determination.

### C. PROFESSIONAL STATE ACTION CONSPIRACY (2023-2024)

17. Defendants SMITH and LARCH COUNSELING, acting under color of state licensing authority, joined the conspiracy by:

a) Implementing institutional policies excluding the judicially-determined superior parent;
b) Systematically denying equal participation in therapeutic care;
c) Enabling identity destruction through failure to correct constitutional violations.

18. As licensed professionals exercising state authority, Defendants SMITH and LARCH COUNSELING became state actors subject to constitutional constraints under *West v. Atkins*, 487 U.S. 42 (1988).

### D. DOCUMENTED CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS (2024-2025)

19. On May 1, 2025, Defendant SMITH documented systematic constitutional violations in official professional records:

> "Client called stepmom, 'mom' throughout our session"

20. Rather than correcting this direct violation of judicial parental relationship determinations, Defendant SMITH enabled continued constitutional violations through professional inaction.

21. This documentation proves systematic conspiracy between all Defendants to violate federally protected parental rights.

### E. CHILD ENDANGERMENT ESCALATION (2025)

22. In April 2025, six-year-old Raina disclosed sexual abuse by "Grandpa" to Defendants' professional network.

23. Rather than protective action, Defendants have:
a) Abandoned investigation for 57+ days;
b) Continued systematic persecution of protective parent;
c) Maintained child's exposure to reported danger.

24. This pattern proves Defendants prioritize constitutional violation conspiracy over child protection.

## V. CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS

### COUNT I: FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS VIOLATION (42 U.S.C. § 1983)

25. Plaintiff incorporates all previous allegations by reference.

26. The Fourteenth Amendment protects fundamental liberty interests in family relationships and parental rights. *Troxel v. Granville*, 530 U.S. 57 (2000).

27. Defendants, acting under color of state law, systematically denied Plaintiff equal treatment despite judicial findings of parental superiority.

28. Defendants' coordinated action deprived Plaintiff of fundamental constitutional rights without due process of law.

29. As a direct and proximate result, Plaintiff suffered constitutional harm, emotional distress, and violation of fundamental parental relationships.

### COUNT II: FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT EQUAL PROTECTION VIOLATION (42 U.S.C. § 1983)

30. Plaintiff incorporates all previous allegations by reference.

31. The Equal Protection Clause prohibits gender-based discrimination without important governmental justification. *Craig v. Boren*, 429 U.S. 190 (1976).

32. Defendants systematically treated the female superior parent as inferior to the male parent found untruthful and insensitive by the court.

33. This gender-based discrimination lacks constitutional justification and violates equal protection guarantees.

34. As a direct and proximate result, Plaintiff suffered constitutional harm and gender-based persecution.

### COUNT III: CONSPIRACY AGAINST CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS (42 U.S.C. § 1983)

35. Plaintiff incorporates all previous allegations by reference.

36. Defendants conspired and acted in concert to deprive Plaintiff of federally protected constitutional rights.

37. The conspiracy involved coordinated action between private parties and state actors to systematically violate judicial determinations and constitutional protections.

38. Defendants' conspiracy succeeded in denying Plaintiff fundamental parental rights for seven months through systematic coordination.

39. As a direct and proximate result, Plaintiff suffered constitutional violations requiring federal remedy and institutional reform.
